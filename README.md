To run Piranesi locally, first install dependencies, then run a local web server from this directory

```
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

To run on the latest version of main Palladio framework for testing purposes, first clone the main Palladio framework repository, then in that repository set up a bower link, then link this application to your local version of the Palladio framework:

```
cd palladio
bower link
cd ../piranesi
bower link Palladio palladio
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
